You are an expert full-stack AI software engineer, product architect, and UI/UX designer. Your task is to build a full-featured, customizable AI-powered Sales Automation Platform that helps businesses manage, automate, and scale their sales pipeline — from lead capture to conversion — using open-source tools and APIs like Mistral/OpenRouter.
🏗️ Phase 1: Core Architecture Setup
Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js (NestJS / Express)
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI
Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
AI: Mistral/OpenRouter API
Workflow Automation: N8N (self-hosted)
Auth: OAuth 2.0 (Google, LinkedIn)
Deployment: Docker + Nginx + Railway/Render
Implement Core Modules:
User Authentication & Role Management
Company and Team setup
Lead & Contact Management
Activity Tracker (Emails, Messages, Notes)
UI/UX Requirements:
Clean, dashboard-style UI inspired by Notion + Linear + HubSpot
Drag-and-drop elements for workflows
Real-time lead updates
Light/Dark mode with minimalistic color palette
🤖 Phase 2: AI-Powered Smart Inbox Integration
Integrations:
Connect Gmail API (via OAuth 2.0)
Connect LinkedIn API (via OAuth 2.0)
Enable bi-directional sync: read incoming/outgoing messages.
AI Automation (via Mistral/OpenRouter):
Use AI to classify emails → “Lead Inquiry”, “Follow-up”, “Negotiation”, “Closed”, etc.
Auto-create or update lead entries in the database based on detected intent.
Summarize each email thread to display a short digest under each contact/company profile.
AI should update lead stage dynamically (e.g., from “Prospect” → “In Discussion”).
UI Flow:
“Smart Inbox” page that shows all AI-summarized email threads.
Hovering over an email shows “AI Summary”, “Next Action Suggestion”, and “Confidence Score.”
🔁 Phase 3: Workflow Builder with N8N
Integration:
Embed or connect with N8N API for creating workflows.
Allow users to design drag-and-drop workflows directly inside the app.
Example workflow:
Trigger: New lead from Gmail → AI classifies → Create record in app → Send Slack alert → Schedule LinkedIn message.
Custom AI Nodes:
“AI Classify” node — uses Mistral for intent detection.
“AI Summarize” node — for email summarization.
“AI Generate Reply” node — for auto-response suggestions.
Workflow Template Library:
Prebuilt templates (Lead Nurturing, Cold Outreach, Abandoned Lead Recovery, etc.)
Users can clone and modify templates.
🧩 Phase 4: Relation Map & Visualization
Dynamic Graph View:
Visualize companies, contacts, and leads as nodes in a 3D graph (using D3.js or Cytoscape.js).
Edges show relationships like:
“Replied to”
“Introduced by”
“Followed up on”
“Same Company”
Clicking a node opens an AI summary popup showing the latest interactions and next recommended step.
AI-Powered Insights:
Highlight “hot” leads (based on frequency or sentiment in emails).
Suggest “who to contact next” based on engagement level and time since last interaction.
💬 Phase 5: AI Copilot & Recommendations
AI Sales Copilot Panel:
Natural language chat interface:
“Show me all leads that haven’t replied in 7 days.”
“Generate a follow-up message for the lead from Tesla.”
“What’s the current pipeline conversion rate?”
Integrate Mistral API to interpret and run structured SQL queries or generate summaries.
Email Composer:
Context-aware auto-suggestion using Mistral.
Supports tone adjustment (Professional / Friendly / Persuasive).
Suggest next-step CTA based on lead’s status.
⚙️ Phase 6: Deployment & Scalability
Microservice Split: Separate services for:
Auth
AI Engine
Workflow Engine
CRM Core
Analytics Engine
Monitoring & Logs: Use OpenTelemetry + Grafana for system insights.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions with Docker image deployment to Render/Railway.
💡 Stretch Goals (Optional)
Voice-to-text summarization for calls (using Whisper or Vosk).
Chrome extension for quick lead capture from LinkedIn or Gmail.
Mobile version using Flutter or React Native.
AI-based lead scoring model trained on engagement data.
